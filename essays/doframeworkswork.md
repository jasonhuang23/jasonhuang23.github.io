 A style of a website either catches our attention, or drives us away from a specific website. So why do some websites have such poor styling? We may never know, but Semantic UI makes it easy for software developers to style websites without the use of only raw HTML and CSS. The problem with using only raw HTML and CSS is that it can require typing out more code and the results aren't the greatest. With a UI framework such as Semantic UI, software developers are able easily style websites all by defining classes to different properties and by doing it concisely.

 Personally, I have never used any other UI frameworks but I do praise Semantic UI for their easy implementation. The main thing that stood out that made Semantic UI so easy was their ability to use normal language when declaring what your want. And that is so simple, there aren't any loops or turns, you get exactly what you ask for. For example, if you wanted a blue button, all you need to do is make a button with a class called "blue button" and WAM BAM you got yourself a blue button. Another example would be making a top menu bar, all we need to do is create a div with a "ui menu" class. Adding to that, we can also have various styles such as, a borderless menu or even a inverted menu. With changes such as this, all we need to do is put in what we want which is a "ui borderless inverted menu", no CSS or HTML styling needed. Things such as containers and grids will also display flawlessly on any webpage without the need to adjust the margins or padding in css, unless you really need it.  

 Although it may sound easy. learning Semantic UI will take some time. The UI consists of 15 elements and along with those elements comes with a couple of variations. In total, it took 4 hours in order to learn the framework. It will be time consuming getting used to declaring the right element that you want, but in the end it will be all worth it. Also, if you were to ever get stuck, based on personal experience, the Semantic UI page provides examples of the usage of different elements which are really helpful when referring to how to implement a certain element correctly. Learning Semantic UI will not only  save you time on typing out extra code to style your different dividers, but Semantic UI will do a great job in creating the perfect element for your website.
