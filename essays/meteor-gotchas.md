  Apart from the fact that everytime I try running Meteor, 30 minutes have already elasped before I am prompted with localhost:3000.
  There was a problem that I have encountered while doing digits 3, and that was when trying to display the Home-page onto digits. As I completed all the tasks leading up to this point,
  it was time to display the home-page. But, as Meteor restarted, nothing showed up, how strange. As I tried retracing my steps throughout the practice WOD, I could not seem to be able to fix the problem. I checked all the syntax,
  made sure that the Collections was named correctly, and made sure that the datafields that I inputted matched. But, 
  nothing seemed to have worked. I was ultimately prompted with the digits homepage with no data, and an inverted menubar. It was very fustrating
  and I honestly would have restarted the whole thing until I randomly decided to check Slack to see if anybody else was encountering the same problem
  that I had, and what did you know, there was actually somebody else that encountered the same problem that made me so fustrated. Finally, as I read through the
  solution, I was felt like a complete idiot. It turns out that I had forgot to import a file onto my home-page.js, and just of that one little mistake
  hindered me from finally finishing my WOD. That is why after going through the experience, I realized that it is really important to make sure that whenever you're creating a new file,
  that it is important that you make sure you imported all the data that you need because 9/10 times, that maybe the reason why your application is showing up the way that it is suppose to be.
