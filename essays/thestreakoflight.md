Meteor claims to be the fastest way to build Javascript apps,  but is it really? Well for me, I wouldn’t really know because this is actually the first Javascript framework that I’ve ever used and from the looks of it, it took a while to get used to. My first experience with Meteor was very confusing and overwhelming. There were just so many classes between the pages, client, and server side that I just couldn’t take in all at once. It really is a learning curve and although I’ve been using Meteor for a little over 2 weeks, I still consider myself to be a newbie. While using Meteor, I did notice a pro and some cons that come along with learning this framework.  A pro was that Meteor included a simple template to get your app started. On the other hand, a couple of cons that stood out to me were, the imports, and the boot up time for an app. 

For a beginner like me, I appreciated the fact that before building an app, there was a meteor sample template to work off of. Although it doesn’t seem much at first, with only a “Click Me” button and a counter tracking how much times you clicked it. It really benefited a beginner like me because, It gave me a sense of how Javascript, HTML, & CSS all worked together. Also, with understanding how the sample template worked, it made it much easier and less confusing when we had to create a Meteor tasklist, and if there wasn’t a sample template to beginning, It would have taken me longer to understand the material. 

Along with the pro of Meteor, comes it’s cons. A small problem that I had while using Meteor were the imports. I’ve experienced multiple times where I wasn’t able to get my [Digits](https://github.com/jasonhuang23/digits)application running because of a simple mistake of not importing a file. This made the experience really frustrating because then I had to dig through each file tracing each import and it just caused a big headache for me. Although I know someone of the blame is towards me for not tracing my imports, I just wish that whenever Meteor restarts on the terminal, we can be indicated that a certain file was not imported, which could help save a lot of time. 
	
Now, the biggest problem I had with Meteor was not while it was running, but when it was just getting started. Yes, I am talking about the major problem that a lot of other students have faced, and that was the load time of initializing meteor npm run install onto the terminal. Personally, I first experienced this problem back on [Digits Part 1](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f17/morea/meteor-2/experience-meteor-digits-1.html). I was getting everything set up and things seemed to be running smoothly until I ran 
“meteor --settings  ../config/settings.development.json” onto the terminal, and I was left speechless. At first I knew my computer was slow to begin with so I didn't mind the loading time, but I didn’t expect this command to literally take overnight and then some, to finally run the app. At times I thought my computer had somehow froze because the spinner on the terminal was just not spinning. Luckily, for the week of Digits WODs I would do them a day ahead, or else I do not think I would have finished them on time. This problem not only gave me a hard time during the Practice WODs but also during the actual WOD. I was ultimately stuck on meteor npm run install for at least ~15 minutes until it finally ran, and that only left me a short amount of time to actually complete the WOD. Although I know this problem has to do with my computer being too slow, it was just really frustrating waiting for the app to finally load.
