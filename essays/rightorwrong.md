  Would you do the right thing knowing that it was wrong? This is an issue software engineers will mostly encounter more than once in their careers, and that is why it is important we learn about coding ethics.
  To me, ethics in software engineering bascially means creating products/software for good intentions and never the opposite. Each line of code implemented, should always be used improve the lives of the users, whether it's making software more user friendly
  or even making it easier for users to accesss, these are all practices of good ethics in software engineering. A case study that showed an unethical way of software engineering can be found [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e). Although some may
  disagree and say that the writer shouldn't be ashamed of his actions because he knew no better, but I tend to disagree and say he should be ashamed for what he did.
  
  A little bit of background of the story, the writer is a software engineer at a interactive marketing firm, and one day he was given a task to create a quiz for teenage girls to take for a medical firm, which was rigged to always recommend the client's drug. Fast forward, a girl kills herself because of taking it. Although many may side with the writer and say that it wasn't his fault, I believe he has every right to be mad at himself.
   
   The biggest red flag that the writer showed was that he was too selfish, only thought about himself and not about the users. First being the case that he didn't take the time to research about the drug. The writer should have gathered all the background information he needed before he proceeded with the project. That means checking up on what the drug treats, side effects, and etc. But no, the writer blindly completed the project knowing that it was rigged in the first place, and that gives a sense of unethical software engineering because he only thought about himself at that time, and not the user who which the software was intended for. 
   
   Secondly, even after hearing about the death of the girl, he still made time to celebrate with the client. The writer just couldn't skip out on that juicy steak he had with the clients because, even after hearing about the tragedy, he still made time to have dinner with the clients. If he really did care about the software that he created and the harm that it was pose to cause, he should've left the company right then and there and not after the dinner.
