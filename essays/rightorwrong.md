  Would you do the right thing knowing that it was wrong? This is an issue software engineers will mostly encounter more than once in their careers, and that is why it is important we learn about coding ethics.
  To me, ethics in software engineering bascially means creating products/software for good intentions and never the opposite. Each line of code implemented, should always be used improve the lives of the users, whether it's making software more user friendly
  or even making it easier for users to accesss, these are all practices of good ethics in software engineering. A case study that showed an unethical way of software engineering can be found [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e).Although some may
  disagree and say that the writer shouldn't be ashamed of his actions, but I tend to disagree.
