  disagree and say that the writer shouldn't be ashamed of his actions because he knew no better, but I tend to disagree and say he should be ashamed for what he did.
  
  A little bit of background of the story, the writer is a software engineer at a interactive marketing firm, and one day he was given a task to create a quiz for a teenage girls to take, which was rigged to always recommend the client's drug.
