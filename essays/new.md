Where would the world be if it weren't for technology? It has transformed our world into something that would have never been imagined 100 years ago. Humans are now able to connect with each other through different variety of apps without having to pay for a flight to see each other face to face, and the web has become a big source in sharing information easily and effectivly to one another. Although these are just two ways technology benefits us, I've always had a passion for technoloy and it was only ideal to work towards a field in Computer Science. 


Although software engineering has been a fairly new topic for me, I've always been interested in learning and building things. The fact that software engineering allows for people to create anything that they desire is a really fascinating thing. This was the main point that stood out to me and really made me interested in this career path.  As a software engineer,there are no boundries in what you can make and the only thing that can limit you is your imagination. 


As my software engineering path begins, I hope to experience and learn different skills that can lead me into a successful career in this field. Some skills that I hope to learn is being able to collaborate on a group project, learning different languages, and lastly, learning how to make myself more marketable in the field of software engineering that will hopefully draw attention from different employers.
