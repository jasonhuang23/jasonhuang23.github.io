<img class="ui centered middle image" src="../images/java vs Javascript.jpg">

Learning Javascript was just like learning any other language, spoken or programmed, in the beginning it was very difficult, but as time went on I progressed. Going into this module I was a complete newbie, and still am. But with time, I finally completed my freecodecamp module, and I figured it had some similarities to Java, which is the only other programming language that I know as of now. I know I may be criticized for saying Javascript and Java are sort of similar because in actuality, they are not. Although they both begin with the same “4” letters, I’ve learned that they aren’t similar, but I did see some things that I were very familiar with and that weren’t that foreign to me. 

For beginners, Java and Javascript both use the same terminology. When adding or removing something out of an array, Javascript used functions such as pop(), push() to manipulate arrays, same for Java but used more primarily in a Stack data structure implementation. Another similarity that I’ve also noticed was that the loops were the same in Javascript. It still had the same ‘“for”, and “while” loops which I was comfortable with in Java.

One thing that stood out to me that I really enjoyed about JavaScript was that unlike Java, Javascript didn't require primitive data types when declaring a variable. This made it so that I didn’t have to worry about initializing a number as a long, short, int. Double, and etc. All I had to do was use let and const variable to create declarations, and in my opinion made things very easy to remember, compared to my first time learning Java. It’s really hassle free because now I don’t have to worry about using the wrong primitive type.

To reflect on my first ever WOD, I did not finish and that’s a good thing in my opinion. Not finishing the WOD, really challenged me and showed me what my weaknesses were. The main weakness that I noticed after the first WOD was that I lacked in developing a simple program in under an acceptable time. This was an eye-opener because I knew that if I was unable to create programs on the spot, then that meant I had to put in more time practicing coding and making it in an efficient time. This will also eventually help me in the long run especially in software engineering interviews, where you’re challenged to write out a program in a given time. 

If there was one thing I would change about the WODs are the practice WODs. The first two practice WODs were much more simpler than the actually one, and I think if we were given much more challenging practice WODs, then we will be much more prepared for the actual one.
