<img class>

For this project, I created a program that was able to sort 3 text files ranging from 1000, 5000, and 10000 words. The program will take the 6 main sorts(insertion, bubble, selection, heap, merge, and quick) and sort the files. The main purpose of this program was to learn about sorting performacne in my ICS 211 class. This is shown by having the program output the number of comparisions, swaps,and the amount of time it took to run for all sorting methods for the three different files.
