<img class>

For ICS 211, we were instructed to build a program that included the 6 major sorts (heapsort, mergesrot,quicksrot, bubble, selection, insertion) to sort text files ranging from 1000, 5000, and 10000 words. This assignment was developed to teach us about sorting performance, that is why after each sort is done, the console would also output the number of comparisions, number of swaps, and the amount of time it took to run for all sorting methods for the three different files
