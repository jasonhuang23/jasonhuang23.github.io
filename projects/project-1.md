For ICS 211, we were instructed create a program that simulated a cashier checkout lane at a locat suoer market. The user will be able to create as many express lanes and regular lanes as they want, and as shoppers are added into each lane, the output would show each shopper in each lane with the number of items that they each have. The only catch was that express lanes were only allowed for customers that had 10 and below amount of items, so, whenever a shopper was added to the express lane and had more than 10 items, the console would output the shopper being removed from the express lane and being put into a regular lane. 

The main purpose of the assignment was to teach us how to implement a queue data structure in adding items into the queue and removing them.
